## 🚀 Overview
**SmartSplit** is a modern, algorithm-driven expense tracking application designed to simplify group finances. Unlike standard split apps, SmartSplit uses a **Graph Simplification Algorithm** (Greedy approach) to minimize the total number of transactions required to settle debts among a group.

Built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, it features a glassmorphism UI, real-time data visualization, and an AI-powered financial assistant.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Algorithms
* **Debt Simplification:** Reduces complex debt networks (e.g., A->B->C) into direct payments (A->C), minimizing total transaction volume.
* **Smart Insights:** An "AI Assistant" that analyzes spending patterns to detect top spenders and category warnings (e.g., "High Food Spending").

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
* **Glassmorphism Design:** Beautiful translucent cards with floating animated background blobs.
* **Dark Mode 🌙:** Fully responsive dark/light theme toggle with local storage persistence.
* **Interactive Charts 📊:** Visual breakdown of group spending using `Recharts`.
* **Dynamic Avatars:** Auto-generated unique avatars for every user using `DiceBear API`.

### ⚡ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
